# ironclad
**ironclad** helps developers write defensive, self-documenting Python code.

It enforces parameter types, constrains values with predicates or enums,
and raises precise errors on violationâ€”keeping interfaces explicit and code clean.
Simple, composable guards harden functions and classes with correctness and security,
with minimal overhead and maximum readability.

## Features
* **Strict type checks:** Fail fast on mismatches with clear `TypeError`s.
* **Value constraints:** Allowlists, enums, ranges, and custom predicates.
* **Composable guards:** Combine checks for rich, readable contracts.
* **Low-boilerplate API:** Keep validation close to the signature, not scattered.
* **Security-minded:** Reduce attack surface from unexpected inputs.
